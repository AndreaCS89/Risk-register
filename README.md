# Risk-register
For this activity I have joined a new cybersecurity team at a commercial bank. The team is conducting a risk assessment of the bank's current operational environment. As part of the assessment, they are creating a risk register to help them focus on securing the most vulnerable risks. 

My supervisor asks me to evaluate a set of risks that the cybersecurity team has recorded in the risk register. For each risk, I am expected to first determine how likely that risk is to occur. Then, I have to determine how severely that risk may impact the bank. Finally, I had to calculate a score for the severity of that risk. I then compared scores across all risks so my team can determine how to prioritize their attention for each risk.
